    "Multiple inheritance in Python refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. A class can inherit from more than one base class, allowing it to acquire the attributes and behaviors of each parent class. This enables the class to combine and utilize functionalities from multiple sources, providing flexibility in designing class hierarchies and code reuse. However, multiple inheritance should be used carefully to avoid potential complexities and conflicts that may arise when inheriting from multiple sources."

    "Delegation refers to a programming technique where an object forwards or delegates certain responsibilities or method calls to another object. Instead of inheriting from a class to reuse its behavior, delegation allows objects to hold references to other objects and delegate specific tasks to them. This approach promotes composition over inheritance, enabling greater flexibility and modularity in designing class relationships. Delegation can be used to achieve code reuse, separation of concerns, and to build complex behaviors by combining functionalities from multiple objects."

    "Composition is a concept in Python where objects are combined together to create more complex structures. It involves creating a class that contains instances of other classes as its member variables. The composed class can then utilize the functionalities of its member objects to achieve its desired behavior. Composition enables code reuse, modularity, and flexibility, as objects can be easily replaced or modified without affecting the overall structure. It promotes building complex systems by combining simpler components, allowing for better organization and separation of concerns."

    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is not to enforce true encapsulation or access control, as Python does not have strict access modifiers like some other languages. Instead, the main purpose is to prevent accidental attribute name clashes between different classes. When a double underscore prefix is used, Python automatically transforms the attribute name to include the class name as a prefix, making it less likely to collide with attributes in subclasses or other classes."
