They are computationally efficient and reproducible, but not suitable for applications requiring absolute unpredictability."

However, as the number of trials grows, the distribution tends to converge to its expected or theoretical shape. This is a fundamental principle of probability theory known as the Law of Large Numbers, which states that with more trials, the observed outcomes tend to match the theoretical probabilities more closely, reducing short-term variability."
