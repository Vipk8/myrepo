    "Exception processing in Python is a powerful mechanism for handling and managing errors and exceptional conditions in a program. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error Handling: Exceptions are commonly used to handle errors in Python programs. By using try-except blocks, you can catch specific types of exceptions and handle them gracefully, preventing the program from crashing. Error handling allows you to display meaningful error messages, perform cleanup tasks, or take alternative actions when an error occurs, enhancing the robustness and reliability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Input Validation: Exception processing can be employed to validate user input or data from external sources. Instead of relying solely on conditional statements to check for valid input, you can use exception handling to catch and handle specific input errors. This helps ensure that the program gracefully handles invalid input, prompting the user for correct input or providing appropriate feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Management: Exceptions are useful for managing resources such as files, database connections, or network sockets. By wrapping resource-related operations in try-finally or try-except-finally blocks, you can ensure that resources are properly released or closed, even in the presence of exceptions. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures the proper cleanup of resources, promoting efficient and reliable resource management."

   "source": [
    "If you don't do something extra to treat an exception in Python, it will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by an exception handler or, if not caught at all, it will cause the program to terminate. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised and not handled, the program execution halts, and Python displays a traceback message, which includes the line of code where the exception occurred and the sequence of function calls that led to it. This traceback helps identify the cause of the exception and assists in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, unhandled exceptions result in a program crash, potentially leaving resources unclosed or data in an inconsistent state. Therefore, it is essential to handle exceptions appropriately to gracefully respond to exceptional situations, log error information, perform cleanup tasks, or take alternative actions to ensure the program can continue running or terminate gracefully when necessary."
