    "Regular expressions (regex) offer powerful text pattern matching capabilities in various programming languages. Their benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern Matching**: They enable precise and flexible text pattern matching, making it easier to search, validate, and manipulate strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: Regex engines are highly optimized for speed, making them efficient for tasks like data extraction and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Versatility**: They provide a universal tool for a wide range of tasks, from data validation to text parsing and search-and-replace operations.\n",
