The first 128 Unicode code points (0 to 127) are identical to the ASCII character set, ensuring backward compatibility. This means any valid ASCII text is also valid Unicode text. ASCII characters in a Unicode text file are encoded using a single byte (0 to 127), and they can be seamlessly processed by Unicode-aware systems, applications, and programming languages, making it easy to handle and manipulate ASCII text within the broader context of Unicode."

Since Python 3.x introduces a clear distinction between Unicode strings (`str`) and bytes (`bytes`), code that relied on implicit conversions between them may need adjustments. String-related operations and libraries that assumed default ASCII or a specific encoding may require explicit decoding/encoding to handle Unicode properly. However, this change improves Unicode support, simplifies internationalization, and promotes cleaner, more robust code in the long run, benefiting cross-platform compatibility and multilingual applications."
