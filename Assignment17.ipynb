    "Greedy syntax in regex matches as much as possible, while non-greedy matches as little as possible. Transforming a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one in Python is straightforward: simply add a \"?\" after the quantifier in the regex pattern. For example, the greedy pattern \".*\" (matching any characters) becomes non-greedy \".*?\". This minimal change alters the behavior of the pattern to match the shortest possible substring instead of the longest.\n",
