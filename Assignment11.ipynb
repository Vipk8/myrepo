Metaclasses are useful for customizing class creation and adding additional functionalities to classes. They provide powerful introspection capabilities and are primarily used in advanced scenarios where class-level behavior needs to be altered dynamically."

They achieve this by wrapping the class's methods or attributes, providing additional functionality when those methods are called or attributes are accessed. Class decorators are instance-specific and do not influence the class itself.\n",
