    "The main difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` in Python is their behavior when accessing attributes. `__getattr__` is called when an attribute is not found in the usual way, allowing you to dynamically provide the value. On the other hand, `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access, whether the attribute exists or not, giving you more control but requiring caution to avoid infinite recursion."

The key difference is that properties are bound to a specific class attribute and are defined using the `@property` decorator, whereas descriptors are reusable and can be shared across multiple attributes. Descriptors are defined by creating a class with `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` methods, enabling more fine-grained control over attribute access and manipulation."
