Inside the subclass method, you can call the superclass's method using the `super()` function and then add any additional functionality before or after the superclass method call. This way, you can extend or modify the behavior of the inherited method while still retaining its original implementation."

On the other hand, in a function, variables defined within the function are only accessible within that specific function and have a shorter lifespan, existing only for the duration of the function's execution."
