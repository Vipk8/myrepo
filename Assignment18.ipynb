Unlike text files, binary files are not human-readable without proper interpretation and require specific handling to manipulate their content effectively."

    "Using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk can lead to several issues. One problem is platform-specific endianness, where the byte order may differ between systems, causing data corruption during transfer. Additionally, there's a risk of data inconsistency if the integer size varies across platforms. Direct binary operations may also lack portability and make the code less maintainable. To ensure data integrity and cross-platform compatibility, it's advisable to use standardized formats like JSON or serialization libraries."

When a file is opened with `with`, the file handling is encapsulated within a context manager, ensuring that the file is properly closed, even if exceptions occur during file operations or when the block of code is exited prematurely. This prevents resource leaks and simplifies the code, as developers don't need to explicitly call `file.close()` to ensure proper cleanup, enhancing the code's reliability and readability."
