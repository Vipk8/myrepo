    "Ans:- Both map calls and list comprehensions are used to transform a sequence of data into a new sequence.\n",
    "1. Map calls apply a given function to each element of a sequence and return a new sequence containing the results. In contrast, list comprehensions apply a given expression to each element of a sequence and return a new list containing the results.\n",
    "2. Map calls return an iterator, which generates the results on the fly as needed, while list comprehensions return a list, which is a complete sequence of results.\n",
    "3. Map calls can take any iterable as input, while list comprehensions can only be applied to sequences (lists, tuples, or strings).\n",
    "4. List comprehensions are generally more concise and easier to read, especially for simple transformations. However, map calls can be more efficient in some cases, particularly when working with large sequences or complex transformations."
